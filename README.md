# auto_coder

## Overview

`auto_coder` is a Python-based framework designed to streamline and automate the generation and refinement of code based on structured configurations. The project allows users to dynamically generate code snippets, scripts, and modules based on YAML-based configuration files and mock data handling.

## Features

- **YAML-Based Configuration**: Define and manage your coding structure using YAML, making it easy to configure your project flow.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate Python code snippets and modules based on predefined templates.
- **Dynamic Agent-Based Reflection**: Utilize agents that can reflect upon and refine code, ensuring adaptability and continuous improvement.
- **Mock Data Handling**: Handle mock data to simulate code execution environments for testing and validation.
- **Integration Ready**: Designed for easy integration with existing CI/CD pipelines and modern development workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using `auto_coder`, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Pip

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto_coder.git
cd auto_coder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To start generating code based on a YAML configuration file, use the following command:

```bash
python auto_coder.py --config path_to_config.yaml
```

This will automatically generate code according to the templates and structure defined in the YAML configuration file.

### YAML Configuration Example

Below is an example of a YAML configuration for `auto_coder`:

```yaml
code_structure:
  - file_name: example_module.py
    functions:
      - name: example_function
        parameters:
          - param1
          - param2
        return: output
        docstring: |
          This is an example function that processes param1 and param2.
```

### Mock Data Handling

To include mock data for testing code execution:

```yaml
mock_data:
  example_function:
    param1: "sample_data1"
    param2: "sample_data2"
    expected_output: "expected_output"
```
